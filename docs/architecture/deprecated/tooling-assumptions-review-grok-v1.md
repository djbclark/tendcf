# Tooling assumptions review — Grok (v1)

- **Date:** 2026-08-08
- **Slug:** `grok`
- **Brief:** `docs/architecture/TOOLING-REVIEW-BRIEF.md`
- **Ground truth read:** `architecture-final-v1.md`, `redteam-trust-layer-openai-v1.md`,
  `ideas-dump-claude.md`, `~/src/ops-worktrees/README.md` (2026-08-06 double-merge
  incident), on-disk justfiles / Ansible serverapps / secretspec / CFEngine /
  site-djbclark ops-release docs under `~/ops`.
- **Web verification:** mise task docs (jdx.dev, crawled 2026-08), OpenHands SDK
  security guide, go-task docs, Tailscale ACL/grants docs, minisign/signify,
  deploy-rs/comin context. Training memory is not used as feature evidence.

This review systematically challenges every load-bearing tool treated as an
unexamined R11 keep by the tendcf architecture panel. Verdicts aim for reasoned
keeps, not churn. Where the tendcf design (role mesh, Site Model, signed
manifests, consent, Free Sysadmin, cheap-exit) changes the original calculus,
that is called out explicitly.

Expand native recipe deps for pipeline recipes; do not rewrite to another runner yet.                                   |

Trigger: deploy/release choreography needs a real multi-stage DAG _and_ just deps prove insufficient. Not a Phase 0–2 move. |
| **Ansible**                                    | Production service owner; fleet/device deploy adapters                                         | **KEEP**                                                                                              | Final architecture D1: permanent production service owner.

Supply-chain risk is real (RT-08) — pin, SBOM, and sign the APK path; do not replace the broker.                                                                             |

## Priority Question 1 — task runner: `just` vs `mise` tasks vs alternatives

### Ground truth: what `just` is here today

Measured 2026-08-08 on this worktree + `~/ops/site-djbclark/justfile`:

| Metric                           | stayturgid                                                                                      | site-djbclark    | Notes                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Lines                            | ~1244 across `justfile` + `just/*.just`                                                         | ~424             | Brief's "~510" under-counted; modular split grew. |
| Recipes                          | ~147                                                                                            | ~36              | Thin wrappers over Python/bash are the norm.      |
| `import`                         | 6 modules (fleet, kotlin, services, tests, cfengine, site)                                      | —                | Modular surface already exists.                   |
| `{{ }}` interpolations           | ~161                                                                                            | (not re-counted) | Brief's 152 is in the right band.                 |
| `env_var_or_default`             | 11                                                                                              | —                | Hosts/scope/limit plumbing.                       |
| Conditional `if` in vars/recipes | Yes (deploy args, Java home, host limits)                                                       | —                | Non-trivial expression surface.                   |
| Shebang multi-line recipes       | ~17                                                                                             | —                | Bash/python blocks, not one-liners.               |
| Recipes with dependencies        | **~8–9** (`test`, `unit-and-pytest`, `lint`, `kt-check`, `cfbs-build`, `dryrun`, a few aliases) | few              | **DAG is available but almost unused.**           |

Patterns that matter for migration cost:

- Heavy parameterization: `hosts=`, `scope=`, `devices_only=`, recipe args (`deploy host=""`).
- `set shell := ["bash", "-uc"]` and `justfile_directory()`.
- Real work lives in `control/bin/*.py` and Ansible; just is mostly a _discoverable CLI_, not the orchestration engine.
- Operators and agents are trained on `just deploy`, `just health`, `just test`.

### What mise tasks actually provide (verified against current docs)

From [mise task configuration](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/task-configuration.html) and [running tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/running-tasks.html) (docs live as of 2026-08):

| Capability                    | mise                                                                 | just (here)                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Real dependency graph         | **Yes** — `depends`, `depends_post`, `wait_for`                      | Yes, but sparse use                           |
| Parallelism                   | **Parallel by default** (default max 4 jobs); order via depends      | Sequential by default; deps run before recipe |
| Incremental / sources+outputs | **Yes** (mtime + experimental content cache)                         | No (always run)                               |
| Modular includes              | `task_config.includes` (toml dirs, file tasks, experimental `git::`) | `import` / modules                            |
| Templating                    | **Tera** (`{{ }}`, vars, usage templates)                            | just expressions + `{{ }}`                    |
| Args                          | usage-spec (richer flags/completions)                                | recipe params + env vars                      |
| Confirm before run            | `confirm` (does **not** block deps — footgun)                        | Manual / none                                 |
| Human UX (`just --list` docs) | `mise tasks` / descriptions                                          | Excellent, battle-tested here                 |

**Does mise give a real DAG with ordering + parallelism?** Yes. Independent deps run in parallel up to `--jobs`; `depends` forces order; `depends_post` runs after; `wait_for` synchronizes without adding nodes. That is a real DAG scheduler, stronger than just's "run these first" list for complex graphs.

**Is parallel-by-default a footgun for sequential deploy choreography?** **Yes.** A naive port of `deploy → verify → heal` without explicit `depends` edges (or `mise run --jobs 1`) can race. Mitigation is mechanical: model edges, or force serial jobs for production verbs. just's sequential default is safer for ops verbs; mise's default is better for CI fan-out. For this fleet, sequential-safe defaults matter more.

**Can mise express conditional vars and 150+ interpolations?** Mostly yes via Tera + `[vars]` (`default`, `required`, task-local vars) and `env`. The _style_ changes (TOML + Tera vs just DSL). Ugly workarounds appear only for just-specific conveniences (`path_exists` chains for JAVA_HOME, `--set` ergonomics). Not a hard blocker; it is a rewrite tax.

**Modular includes equivalent to `import`?** Close enough: `task_config.includes` plus file tasks. Remote `git::` includes exist (experimental) — useful later for freeops shared tasks, not required now.

**Honest rewrite cost of the recipe surface:** for ~180 recipes that are mostly thin wrappers, a careful mechanical port is on the order of **3–8 engineer-days** for syntax, plus **1–2 weeks** of agent/operator muscle-memory, CI, docs, and site-djbclark parity — call it **~2–3 calendar weeks** to trust. The risk is not typing; it is subtle ordering bugs under parallel default and dual-path confusion during transition.

### Alternatives (serious short takes)

| Runner              | Fit                                                       | Call                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **just (stay)**     | Best human verb surface; already modular; deps under-used | Primary recommendation                                             |
| **mise tasks**      | Best DAG + sources/outputs _if_ already all-in on mise    | Secondary / later hybrid                                           |
| **go-task**         | YAML, deps (parallel), sources/generates, includes        | Best "leave just" alternative; still a full rewrite                |
| **make**            | True classic DAG, ubiquitous                              | Worse DX; tabs/PHONY tax; no win over just+deps                    |
| **mask**            | Markdown = docs+tasks (R9 rhyme)                          | Too weak for this surface; just can already read `.md` just blocks |
| **moon / turbo**    | JS monorepo graphs                                        | Wrong domain                                                       |
| **dagger**          | Containerized pipelines                                   | Violates "no Docker substrate" posture                             |
| **cargo-make / xc** | Ecosystem-specific                                        | No                                                                 |

### Correcting the "mise tasks re-couple D3 / hurt R5" claim

**The claim is wrong as stated.**

- D3 assigns: mise = toolchain SSOT + **host-baseline exit renderer**; Ansible adapters = **service** exit. That is about _what owns packages vs services_, not about _which binary runs `test` or `deploy`_.
- mise runs on Ubuntu the same as on macOS. Putting tasks in `mise.toml` does not force mise to own launchd/systemd, does not break the exit drill, and does not re-implement Vector/Caddy ownership.
- What _would_ re-couple D3 is using mise **bootstrap services** (`dev.mise.*` only is already allowed for personal agents) to own production `com.stayturgid.*` units. **Task recipes ≠ service ownership.**

Partial truth nearby: collapsing _all_ operator mental model into mise can blur the architecture diagram for newcomers ("mise does everything"). That is a documentation risk, not an R5 technical failure.

### Hybrid: two tools vs one

| Hybrid                               | Pros                                    | Cons                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **just façade + mise DAG internals** | Keep UX; gain graph for heavy pipelines | Two systems; agents must know which owns what            |
| **mise only**                        | One tool with toolchains+tasks          | Large rewrite; parallel footguns; weaker list UX for ops |
| **just only + denser deps**          | Zero new tool; uses existing skill      | Weaker incremental builds; no sources/outputs            |

**Two full surfaces is worse than one** for this operator+multi-agent environment. A _narrow_ hybrid (mise tasks only for 3–5 internal CI-style graphs, never advertised as human verbs) is acceptable later. A dual public CLI (`just deploy` vs `mise run deploy`) is not.

### Recommendation (ONE path)

**Path: KEEP `just` as the only human-facing task runner; KEEP-WITH-CHANGES to actually use its DAG; keep mise for toolchains/bootstrap per D3; do not migrate the verb surface to mise tasks in Phases 0–4.**

#### Migration plan (small, reversible)

1. **Phase 0 (days):** Document recipe dependency policy in AGENTS/coding-rules: any multi-step pipeline (`lint`, `check`, `kt-check`, future `release-preflight`) **must** declare deps; no "run these three just lines" prose without edges.
2. **Phase 0–1:** Refactor the few real pipelines that already want order (`test`/`lint`/`kt-check`/`cfbs-*`/`web-health`) into explicit dep trees; add `release-preflight` / `converge-check` stubs as deps chains when Phase 5 schemas land.
3. **Do not** rewrite `deploy`/`heal`/`firerpa-*` into mise — those already delegate to Python with their own sequencing.
4. **Optional spike (½ day, disposable):** port `kt-check` + `unit-and-pytest` to mise tasks in a branch to validate ergonomics; delete if no clear win.
5. **Revisit trigger for full mise-task (or go-task) evaluation:** (a) more than ~15 recipes need cross-cutting ordered parallelism, or (b) sources/outputs caching becomes load-bearing for agent CI time, or (c) just cannot express a signed-release choreography cleanly.

#### Rollback

- Dep-only just changes: revert commits; recipes still runnable.
- Spike mise tasks: delete `[tasks]` / `mise-tasks/`; no production path depends on them.

## Priority Question 2 — OpenHands SDK security

Source: [OpenHands SDK Security & Action Confirmation](https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk/guides/security) (fetched 2026-08-08).

### What the SDK actually provides

- **Confirmation policies:** `AlwaysConfirm`, `NeverConfirm`, `ConfirmRisky` (thresholded on analyzer risk).
- **Analyzers:** `LLMSecurityAnalyzer`; deterministic `PatternSecurityAnalyzer`, `PolicyRailSecurityAnalyzer`; `EnsembleSecurityAnalyzer` (max concrete severity).
- **Risk levels:** LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / UNKNOWN — **classify for policy, do not hard-deny.**
- **Documented bypass:** `conversation.execute_tool()` **skips** analyzer and confirmation.
- **Documented non-goals:** not a full shell AST, not a sandbox, not a complete prompt-injection solution; pair with isolation for stronger safety.

### Surface A — AI coding agents (Herdr / Ralph / Codex / Claude Code, worktree write)

**Relevant findings:** RT-03 (source-to-signing laundering), the real **2026-08-06** double-merge incident (`ops-worktrees/README.md`: foreign commits + merge without provenance).

| Question                                                                        | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Does OpenHands SDK adoption meaningfully mitigate a compromised/mistaken agent? | **Partially, and only as a soft pre-exec filter** inside an OpenHands-shaped conversation loop. Pattern/PolicyRail catch some `rm -rf`, `curl                                                                                                                                             | sh`, sudo-class strings. They do not stop a determined agent writing a malicious Ansible task that looks like normal code, nor stop `gh pr merge` of foreign commits. |
| Integration cost with Herdr/Ralph/Beads?                                        | **High for the SDK.** Those harnesses are not OpenHands `Conversation` objects. Wiring the full SDK means either wrapping every agent in OpenHands (non-starter) or building a side process that never sees tool calls.                                                                   |
| Vendor _technique_ vs _SDK_?                                                    | **Vendor the technique.** Implement a small deterministic action/command classifier (regex + policy rails + ensemble max-severity) at harness boundaries that _you_ control: shell wrappers, `gh`/`git` hooks, Ralph step gates. Mirror OpenHands patterns without taking the dependency. |

**Verdict Surface A: KEEP-WITH-CHANGES — adopt the _pattern_, not the SDK.**

Concrete cheap wins aligned with the incident writeup:

1. Procedural provenance gate as a **script** (`git log` + `git diff` range checks) required before any merge helper; fail closed under YOLO.
2. Pattern rails on high-risk argv for agent-exposed shell (destructive git, force-push, secrets paths, production deploy).
3. Keep human/operator confirmation for release signing and production deploy — never `NeverConfirm` on those verbs.
4. Do **not** treat LLM risk labels as authorization (RT-09 / advisor-must-not-authorize).

Migration cost: days for hooks + classifier; weeks if someone tries full SDK embedding (don't).

### Surface B — fleet trust layer (signed manifests, consent, pull converge)

Red-team RT-04 / RT-09: capability-enforcing executor; AI advisor must never be an authorization oracle. OpenHands docs: **confirm, don't block**; analyzers return risk; `execute_tool()` bypasses.

| Replace signed capability IR / executor allowlist                                                               | **No.**                                                                                                                                                    |

**Verdict Surface B: no legitimate role as a control-plane gate. Optional non-authorizing advisor feature only after a deterministic executor exists.**

## Full-stack notes (by group)

### Orchestration / config

**Ansible — KEEP.**  
tendcf strengthens the case: role mesh still needs multi-OS config push; R5 exit re-renders services via Ansible adapters; R10 consumers must not need nix-darwin. Failure mode under-considered: playbooks are general-purpose code once signed (RT-03). Mitigation is typed operation IR + check-mode honesty, not replacing Ansible.

**CFEngine — KEEP-WITH-CHANGES.**  
Last-ditch heal is both _recovery_ and _remote exec_. Ground truth: `cf-serverd` ACLs exist (Tailscale CGNAT range, wrapper path); `just cf-run` is preferred over classic cf-runagent. Under consent/trust: CFEngine should remain **break-glass**, logged, network-restricted, and not a silent bypass of signed converge for routine changes. Adding "converge agent alive" promise (proposal-v1) is fine; expanding remote-exec surface is not.

**Gradle — KEEP.** APK builds stay Gradle; suite hashes and deploys outputs.

### Android

**Termux stack — KEEP.** R4 settled. Reproducibility gap on `pkg` is real; answer is content-addressed artifact lane for critical binaries, not nix-on-droid.

**Shizuku fork — KEEP** with supply-chain hygiene (RT-08): pin upstream, own signing, SBOM in release manifests when Android artifacts enter ops-v.

**FIRERPA/lamda — KEEP** as backup heal. Compromise of FIRERPA key is high impact (`secretspec` already declares it); rotate like other fleet roots; never let FIRERPA install unsigned "emergency" code without the same gates as primary deploy.

**ADB-over-Tailscale — KEEP** transport; authorization must not equal "ADB reachable."

### Network / identity

**Tailscale — KEEP-WITH-CHANGES.**  
Encryption and peer identity are real. **ACLs/grants are not specified as fleet policy today** (ideas-dump + red-team). Tailscale now pushes **grants** as the preferred policy syntax (deny-by-default, tags, groups). Before consented / lower-trust devices share a tailnet:

- Tag roles: `tag:operator`, `tag:android-fleet`, `tag:android-consented`, `tag:obs`, `tag:builder`, …
- Grants: operator → fleet admin ports; consented ↛ builder SSH; obs scrape only metrics ports; deny lateral movement defaults.
- Store a **reviewed** policy template in site overlay docs (not necessarily auto-applied from public stayturgid).

**SSH CA — KEEP.** Proves host/user keys; does not prove release freshness or cache honesty. Do not overload it as a release authority.

### Secrets

**secretspec — KEEP.** Sole declaration authority is correct under R11 and Free Sysadmin (declarations public-safe; values never git). Ensure provider backends and bootstrap exceptions stay narrow (architecture § secrets).

### Observability

**Vector, OpenObserve, VictoriaMetrics, otelcol-contrib, Grafana, Caddy, blackbox_exporter, OliveTin — KEEP** as a set.

tendcf changes _placement_ (obs-main off the sleeping M1 Air → VPS role), not _tool choice_. OliveTin must remain a thin button face over existing just/Ansible verbs so it does not become a second unsigned remote-exec path. OpenObserve clean-log soak remains an ops gate, not a redesign trigger.

### Agent orchestration

**Beads / Ralph / Herdr — KEEP** (Ralph KEEP-WITH-CHANGES).  
They are the control plane for _coding_ work, not fleet converge. Long-term schema kinship with ChangePlan is interesting (ideas-dump); do not merge schemas in v1.

**Worktree bare-store — KEEP-WITH-CHANGES.**  
Architecture is sound (shared objects, task isolation). Failure was concurrent writers + merge without provenance. Automate: claim file or Beads ownership field for workspace path; pre-merge script; refuse commits if `git` detects foreign authors on branch without operator override flag.

### Literate

**Entangled — KEEP** at current narrow scope (SITE-CONTRACT + parity CI). stitch + parallel agents = corruption risk (ideas-dump); extend cross-agent ownership rules to literate sources before any expansion (D5).

### Release / VCS

**git + GitHub Releases + gh + ops-v — KEEP.**  
Mechanics in site-djbclark (`ops-release-check/deploy`, annotated tags, `ops-release.json`) are the right coordination spine. Phase 5 adds signed manifests _on top_, not a different train.

**flock + claim files — KEEP.**  
`ops-release.lock` + `ops-release.claim.json` are the right small single-writer primitive; reuse for other single-writer role mutations (architecture lease/fencing).

### Runtimes / packages

**Python+uv, Bun, Homebrew (with single-owner discipline), apt, Termux pkg — KEEP** as above. mise should pin the language tools; brew/apt remain OS package channels under the ownership matrix.

### Proposed-but-not-yet-adopted

| Tool               | Verdict                             | Migration / cost note                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **minisign**       | Adopt (Phase 5)                     | Small binary on Mac + Termux; ceremony docs; **not** sufficient alone (RT-01 threshold root still required before pull). |
| **signify**        | Accept as verify-compatible cousin  | Prefer minisign for trusted comments + packaging ergonomics.                                                             |
| **deploy-rs**      | Adopt for NixOS push (Phase 4)      | Days to wire flake profiles; rollback-on-failure is the feature earn.                                                    |
| **harmonia**       | Later, demand-driven                | Lowest-complexity cache role; still total trust on cache key (RT-05).                                                    |
| **attic**          | Later only if multi-uploader needed | Higher ops cost.                                                                                                         |
| **nixos-anywhere** | Adopt Phase 4 bootstrap             | One-shot; then deploy-rs / rebuild.                                                                                      |
| **comin**          | Rejection stands                    | NixOS-only auto-gitops fights transparent multi-OS converge agent.                                                       |

| **CFEngine remote-exec**                            | Recovery path _is_ remote code execution      | Tailnet grants; authz on wrapper; audit logs; break-glass only  |
| **Release signing key (future minisign)**           | One key = fleet root (RT-01)                  | Threshold root metadata before pull; separate emergency key     |
| **Nix cache key (harmonia/attic)**                  | Trusted cache ⇒ arbitrary store paths (RT-05) | Separate builder/cache/release authority; pin critical closures |

| **Tailscale policy (or lack)**                      | "On tailnet" used as authz                    | Explicit tags/grants before consented devices                   |
| **Agent worktree write + `gh` auth**                | Already bit once (2026-08-06)                 | Provenance automation; no shared writable main                  |
| **OpenHands-style LLM analyzer if misused as gate** | Looks like security, is advice                | Never in executor path                                          |

## Summary recommendations (operator-facing)

1. **Task runner:** stay on **just**; implement real recipe DAGs where pipelines exist; **do not** fold the public verb surface into mise tasks now. The "mise recouples D3" objection is **incorrect**; the right objection is rewrite cost + parallel footguns + two CLIs.
2. **OpenHands:** **do not** adopt the SDK into Herdr/Ralph/Codex. **Do** copy deterministic pattern/rail ensemble ideas into harness gates. **No** role as fleet authorization.
3. **Biggest unexamined policy gap:** **Tailscale grants/tags** — close in Phase 0/3 docs + live policy before consented devices.
4. **Biggest under-modeled attack surface among "keeps":** **CFEngine remote-exec** and **future single release key** — architecture already points at mitigations; implement them before pull converge.
5. **Proposed adopts:** minisign + deploy-rs + nixos-anywhere on the existing phase plan; harmonia/attic demand-driven; comin rejection upheld.
